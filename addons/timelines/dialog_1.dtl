wizard: Your mission is simple, peasant. You must deliver this boulder to me.
wizard: The situation is dire... so much so that even useless and unimportant people like you must help for the cause.
wizard: This boulder fell from the great Heavens to aid us in our righteous endeavor.
wizard: I will meet you at the edge of the forest.
wizard: I must have this holy rock and use it to craft a sword blessed by God for the gallant knight, Radulf Bauer.
wizard: He is the only one who can save us from those devils!
wizard: But first you must get started pushing this boulder... and keep pushing forward, no matter what...
wizard: Even if you fail, even after you fail, keep pushing forward!
